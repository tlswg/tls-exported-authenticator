--- abstract

This document describes a mechanism in Transport Layer Security (TLS) to
provide an exportable proof of ownership of a certificate that can be
transmitted out of band and verified by the other party.

# Introduction

This document provides a way to authenticate one party of a Transport Layer
Security (TLS) communication to another using a certificate after the session
has been established.  This allows both the client and server to prove ownership
of additional identities at any time after the handshake has completed.  This
proof of authentication can be exported and transmitted out of band from one
party to be validated by the other party.

This mechanism provides two advantages over the authentication that TLS natively
provides:

multiple identities -

: Endpoints that are authoritative for multiple identities - but do not have a
  single certificate that includes all of the identities - can authenticate with
  those identities over a single connection.

spontaneous authentication -

: Endpoints can authenticate after a connection is established, in response to
  events in a higher-layer protocol, as well as integrating more context.

This document intends to replace much of the functionality of renegotiation
in previous versions of TLS.  It has the advantages over renegotiation of not
requiring additional on-the-wire changes during a connection.  For simplicity,
only TLS 1.2 and later are supported.

Post-handshake authentication is defined in TLS 1.3, but it has
the disadvantage of requiring additional state to be stored in the TLS
state machine and it composes poorly with multiplexed connection protocols
like HTTP/2 {{?RFC7540}}.  It is also only available for client authentication.
This mechanism is intended to be used as part of a replacement for
post-handshake authentication in applications.

# Conventions and Terminology

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
"OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
14 {{!RFC2119}} {{!RFC8174}} when, and only when, they appear in all
capitals, as shown here.

# Authenticator Request

The authenticator request is a structured message that can be exported from either
party of a TLS connection.  It can be transmitted to the other party of
the TLS connection at the application layer.  The application layer protocol
used to send the authenticator SHOULD use TLS as its underlying transport to
keep the request confidential.

An authenticator request message can be constructed by either the client or the
server.  This authenticator request uses the CertificateRequest message structure
from Section 4.3.2 of {{!TLS13=I-D.ietf-tls-tls13}}.  This message does not
include the TLS record layer and is therefore not encrypted with a
handshake key.

The CertificateRequest is used to define the parameters in a request for an
authenticator. The definition for TLS 1.3 is:

       struct {
          opaque certificate_request_context<0..2^8-1>;
          Extension extensions<2..2^16-1>;
       } CertificateRequest;

certificate_request_context:
: An opaque string which identifies the certificate request and which will
be echoed in the authenticator message.  A certificate_request_context
value MUST NOT be repeated for multiple authenticator requests generated by
the same party within the scope of a connection (thus preventing replay
of authenticators).  The certificate_request_context SHOULD be chosen to
be unpredictable to the peer (e.g., by randomly generating it) in order
to prevent an attacker who has temporary access to the peer's private
key from pre-computing valid authenticators.  This value is unrelated to
the certificate_request_context used in post-handshake authentication and
collisions do not need to be avoided.

extensions:
: The extensions that are allowed in this structure include the extensions
defined for CertificateRequest messages defined in Section 4.2. of {{!TLS13}}
and the server_name {{!RFC6066}} extension, which is allowed for
client-generated authenticator requests.

# Authenticator

The authenticator is a structured message that can be exported from either
party of a TLS connection.  It can be transmitted to the other party of
the TLS connection at the application layer.  The application layer protocol
used to send the authenticator SHOULD use TLS as its underlying transport
to keep the certificate confidential.

An authenticator message can be constructed by either the client or the
server given an established TLS connection, a certificate, and a corresponding
private key.  Clients MUST NOT send an authenticator without a preceding
authenticator request; for servers an authenticator request is optional.
The authenticator uses the message structures from Section 4.4 of {{!TLS13}},
but different parameters.  These messages do not include the TLS record layer
and are therefore not encrypted with a handshake key.

## Authenticator Keys

Each authenticator is computed using a Handshake Context and Finished MAC Key
derived from the TLS session.  These values are derived using an exporter as
described in {{!RFC5705}} (for TLS 1.2) or {{!TLS13}} (for
TLS 1.3).  These values use different labels depending on the role of the
sender:

* The Handshake Context is an exporter value that is derived using the label
  "EXPORTER-client authenticator handshake context" or "EXPORTER-server
  authenticator handshake context" for authenticators sent by the client and
  server respectively.

* The Finished MAC Key is an exporter value derived using the label
  "EXPORTER-client authenticator finished key" or "EXPORTER-server authenticator
  finished key" for authenticators sent by the client and server respectively.

The context_value used for the exporter is absent (length zero) for all four
values. The length of the exported value is equal to the length of the output of
the hash function selected in TLS for the pseudorandom function (PRF).  Cipher
suites that do not use the TLS PRF MUST define a hash function that can be used
for this purpose or they cannot be used.  For TLS 1.3 symmetric cipher suites,
the hash algorithm used with HKDF is used.

If the connection is TLS 1.2, the master secret MUST have been computed
with the extended master secret {{!RFC7627}} to avoid key synchronization attacks.

## Authenticator Construction

An authenticator is formed from the concatenation of TLS 1.3 {{!TLS13}}
Certificate, CertificateVerify, and Finished messages.

If an authenticator request is present, the extensions used to guide the
construction of these messages are taken from the authenticator request. If
there is no authenticator request, the extensions are chosen from the TLS
handshake. Only servers can provide an authenticator without a corresponding
request. In such cases, ClientHello extensions are used to determine permissible
extensions in the Certificate message.

### Certificate

The certificate to be used for authentication and any
supporting certificates in the chain. This structure is defined in {{!TLS13}},
Section 4.4.2.

The certificate message contains an opaque string called
certificate_request_context, which is extracted from the authenticator request if
present.  If no authenticator request is provided, the certificate_request_context
can be chosen arbitrarily.

The certificates chosen in the Certificate message MUST conform to the
requirements of a Certificate message in the negotiated version of TLS.  In
particular, the certificate chain MUST be valid for the a signature algorithms
indicated by the peer in the "signature_algorithms" and "signature_algorithms_cert"
extension, as described in Section 4.2.3 of {{!TLS13}} for TLS 1.3 or the "signature_algorithms" extension
from Sections 7.4.2 and 7.4.6 of {{!RFC5246}} for TLS 1.2.

In addition to "signature_algorithms" and "signature_algorithms_cert",
the "server_name" {{!RFC6066}}, "certificate_authorities"
(Section 4.2.4. of {{!TLS13}}), and "oid_filters"
(Section 4.2.5. of {{!TLS13}}) extensions are used to guide certificate
selection.  The extensions, or others that might affect certificate selection,
are taken from the authenticator request if present, or the TLS handshake if not.

Alternative certificate formats such as {{!RFC7250}} Raw Public Keys
are not supported in this version of the specification.

If an authenticator request was provided, the Certificate message MUST contain
only extensions present in the authenticator request.  Otherwise, the
Certificate message MUST contain only extensions present in the TLS handshake.

### CertificateVerify

This message is used to provide explicit proof that an endpoint possesses the
private key corresponding to its certificate.  The definition for TLS 1.3 is:

       struct {
          SignatureScheme algorithm;
          opaque signature<0..2^16-1>;
       } CertificateVerify;

The algorithm field specifies the signature algorithm used (see Section 4.2.3 of {{!TLS13}}
for the definition of this field).  The signature is a digital signature
using that algorithm.

The signature scheme MUST be a valid signature scheme for TLS 1.3. This
excludes all RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 algorithms and combinations of ECDSA and hash
algorithms that are not supported in TLS 1.3.

If an authenticator request is present, the signature algorithm MUST be chosen
from one of the signature schemes in the authenticator request.  Otherwise, the
signature algorithm used should be chosen from the "signature_algorithms" sent
by the peer in the TLS handshake.

The signature is computed using the over the concatenation of:

* A string that consists of octet 32 (0x20) repeated 64 times
* The context string "Exported Authenticator" (which is not NULL-terminated)
* A single 0 byte which serves as the separator
* The hashed authenticator transcript

The authenticator transcript is the hash of the concatenated Handshake Context,
authenticator request (if present), and Certificate message:

~~~
Hash(Handshake Context || authenticator request || Certificate)
~~~

Where Hash is the hash function negotiated by TLS. If the authenticator request
is not present, it is omitted from this construction (that is, it is zero
length).

If the party that generates the exported authenticator does so with a different
connection than the party that is validating it, then the Handshake Context will
not match, resulting in a CertificateVerify message that does not validate.
This includes situations in which the application data is sent via TLS-terminating
proxy.  Given a failed CertificateVerify validation, it may be helpful for
the application to confirm that both peers share the same connection
using a value derived from the connection secrets before taking a user-visible action.

### Finished

A HMAC {{!HMAC=RFC2104}} over the hashed authenticator transcript, which is the
concatenated Handshake Context, authenticator request (if present),
Certificate, and CertificateVerify:

~~~
Hash(Handshake Context || authenticator request ||
     Certificate || CertificateVerify)
~~~

The HMAC is computed using the same hash function using the Finished MAC Key as
a key.

### Authenticator Creation

An endpoint constructs an authenticator by serializing the Certificate, CertificateVerify, and Finished as TLS handshake messages and concatenating the octets:

~~~
Certificate || CertificateVerify || Finished
~~~

A given authenticator can be validated by checking the validity of the
CertificateVerify message given the authenticator request (if used) and recomputing the
Finished message to see if it matches.

# Empty Authenticator

If, given an authenticator request, the endpoint does not have an appropriate certificate
or does not want to return one, it constructs an authenticated refusal
called an empty authenticator.  This is an HMAC over the hashed authenticator
transcript with a Certificate message containing no CertificateEntries
and the CertificateVerify message omitted:

```
Hash(Handshake Context || authenticator request || Certificate)
```

The HMAC is computed using the same hash function using the Finished MAC Key as a key.

# API considerations

The creation and validation of both authenticator requests and authenticators
SHOULD be implemented inside the TLS library even if it is possible to implement
it at the application layer. TLS implementations supporting the use of exported
authenticators MUST provide application programming interfaces by which clients
and servers may request and verify exported authenticator messages.

Notwithstanding the success conditions described below, all APIs MUST fail if:

* the connection uses a TLS version of 1.1 or earlier, or
* the connection is TLS 1.2 and the extended master secret {{!RFC7627}} was not
  used

The following sections describes APIs that are considered necessary to implement exported authenticators.  These are informative only.

## The "request" API

The "request" API takes as input:

* certificate_request_context (from 0 to 255 bytes)
* set of extensions to include (this MUST include signature_algorithms)

It returns an authenticator request, which is a sequence of octets that includes a CertificateRequest message.

## The "get context" API

The "get context" API takes as input:

* authenticator

It returns the certificate_request_context.

## The "authenticate" API

The "authenticate" takes as input:

* a set of certificate chains and associated extensions
(OCSP, SCT, etc.)
* a signer (either the private key associated with the certificate, or interface
to perform private key operation) for each chain
* an optional authenticator request or certificate_request_context (from 0 to 255 bytes)

It returns either the exported authenticator or an empty authenticator
as a sequence of octets.  It is RECOMMENDED that
the logic for selecting the certificates and extensions to include
in the exporter is implemented in the TLS library.  Implementing this
in the TLS library lets the implementer take advantage of existing
extension and certificate selection logic.

It is also possible to implement this API outside of the TLS library using
TLS exporters.  This may be preferable in cases where the application
does not have access to a TLS library with these APIs or when TLS is
handled independently of the application layer protocol.

## The "validate" API

The "validate" API takes as input:

* an optional authenticator request
* an authenticator

It returns the certificate chain and extensions and a status to indicate
whether the authenticator is valid or not.  If the authenticator was
empty - that is, it did not contain a certificate - the certificate
chain will contain no certificates.

# IANA Considerations

This document has no IANA actions.

# Security Considerations {#security}

The Certificate/Verify/Finished pattern intentionally looks like the TLS 1.3
pattern which now has been analyzed several times.  In the case where the
client presents an authenticator to a server, {{SIGMAC}} presents a relevant
framework for analysis.

Authenticators are independent and unidirectional. There is no explicit state change
inside TLS when an authenticator is either created or validated.

* This property makes it difficult to formally prove
that a server is jointly authoritative over multiple certificates, rather than
individually authoritative over each.
* There is no indication in the TLS layer about which point in time an authenticator was
computed.  Any feedback about the time of creation or validation of the authenticator
should be tracked as part of the application layer semantics if required.

The signatures generated with this API cover the context string
"Exported Authenticator" and therefore cannot be transplanted into other
protocols.
